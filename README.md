========

This project can be used to test the recognition accuracy of Chinese handwriting input method. It is composed of two parts: a PC and a mobile client(Android Client).

Now, we open the test datasets for research. This database is a online handwritten Chinese character database that consists of 5 datasets. These comprise a simplified Chinese set (denoted SimpleChar) in GB2312-80 standard, traditional Chinese set (denoted TradChar) in Big5 standard, mixed simplified and traditional Chinese set (denoted SimpTradChar), rarely-used Chinese character set (denoted as RarelyUsedChar), and symbol set (denoted as SymbolChar). Note that SymbolChar contains uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, common symbols, and so on. Each set contains five subsets, which are numbered from 1 to 5.

Note that all the files have been encrypted, and you can contact us(lianwen.jin@gmail.com) to get the password.
